This is a interactive game for 11 Mens Morris, a variant of 9 Mens
Morris.  Originally, it was intended to be a simulator for 11 Mens
Morris, but the simulator engine has not been written yet.  Morris Sim
makes use of bit packing and vector optimizations so that the
simulator can run as quickly as possible.  Note that these
optimizations can hamper portability to processor architectures that
are not x86 or x86-64.  The unoptimized code is not tested as much as
the optimized code, but it should work just as well as the optimized
code.

Installation instructions for building Morris Sim from the source are
in the file INSTALL.  Be sure to read about how to set up proper
compiler optimization.  Right now, Debian packages, Red Hat packages,
(Mac) OS X DMG installers, Nullsoft installers, and Windows MSI
installer packages are only supported through manual creation.  There
are no automatic scripts for these included within the source package.

The file AUTHORS contains a list of code contributors to this project.
For the list of translators, see the file TRANSLATORS.

For a list of user visible changes, see the file NEWS.  "ChangeLog"
contains a list of source code changes.  "COPYING" contains Morris
Sim's license: the Expat MIT license.

"autogen.sh" is used to generate files related to the build system.
"aclocal.m4" is used by "configure" as a local list of macros used
from other macro packages.  "config.h.in" is processed by "configure"
to create a configuration header when building the project.
"configure.ac" is the Autoconf source file that "configure" is
generated from.

"Makefile.am" is the Automake source file used to generate
"Makefile.in".  "Makefile.in" is processed by "configure" to create
the project makefile.

Here is a brief overview of the subdirectories:
build-aux/      Auxiliary build tools for Autoconf, Automake, and
                Libtool
